There are many sites where you can make money from. In this blog i'll be talking about tips and tricks on how to do this. 

## What sites can i use to make money from?

- 𝗵𝘁𝘁𝗽𝘀://𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗹𝗮𝗯.𝗰𝗼𝗺

- 𝗵𝘁𝘁𝗽𝘀://𝘄𝘄𝘄.𝘀𝘄𝗮𝗴𝗯𝘂𝗰𝗸𝘀.𝗰𝗼𝗺

These sites are also known as "𝗚𝗣𝗧 𝗦𝗶𝘁𝗲𝘀", GPT Stands for "𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗣𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗧𝗼"

The sites i recommend are earnlab, gain.gg, kash.gg and chequity.io.
In my personal opinion these are the best sites you can use, they have great support, fast payouts and more. These sites have great support and lots of withdrawl options. 

## What are the withdrawl options

## Best Ways To Earn

Doing game offers are the best way to earn money, other offers like profit offers are also good. Both of these pay the most money. For Example an offer will say "make a $5 purchase" usually these type of offers will pay more then what you will pay. 

The 𝙄𝙢𝙖𝙜𝙚 shown below is a "raid shadow legends" offer, this offer is available for pc.

## Important Things To Know:

Spending money on game offers can help speed up progress and make it easier to complete but the main thing to these game offers is 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀.

If its your first time doing one, its recommended to reach out to people who might've done this offer before. you can also find guides on reddit, discord, etc.

Another thing you should know is that these sites do not permit any sort of vpns, this can get your account terminated. Using emulators and having multiple accounts 
is also prohibted. As long as you follow the TOS you should be fine and shouldn't be worried about getting your account banned.

# Minimize Tracking Issues 

Game Offers will require you to allow tracking in the app, so make sure you do that, or else the offer won't track your progress. When you click on a game offer and it redirects you to the app store its recommended that you stay in the app store and open the game from there.

Losing internet connection while a game is downloading can cause tracking issues. Some things that you should also note is that losing internet connection while your in the middle of doing a game offer will not cause tracking issues.

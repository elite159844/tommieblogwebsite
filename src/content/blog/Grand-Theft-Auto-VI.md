So if you haven't known already, gta 6 is the most anticipated game ever and its set to come out fall 2025 on the PS5 and the Xbox Series X/S. I'll be sharing my personal thoughts about the game and what i look forward to next year. 

## Trailer 2

So its been exactly 11 months since the first trailer for gta 6 came out. Many people including me have been anticipating that trailer 2 would come soon. Personally i think trailer 2 will most likely come before the end of this year around november-december, or it could possibily come out early next year. News surrounding gta 6 has been pretty dry and quiet lately.

"𝗔𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗴, 𝗴𝘁𝗮 𝟲 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝟭 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝟮𝟮𝟬 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀..."

## After The Trailer 

It was the most viewed game trailer ever and reached insane amounts of views in the first 24 hours. I remember watching the trailer back in december of last year and i was hyped. Pretty much december was filled with people talking about the trailer non stop, analyzing every bit of detail. 

## 2025

My most anticipated game next year is obviously gta 6 but there is also another big game that im personally excited to play aswell, "𝗠𝗮𝗳𝗶𝗮 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝗹𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝘆", this game is also set to release in 2025. 

I've been a gta fan for a while now, i played most of the gta games including, vice city, san andreas, gta 3, gta 4, and of course gta 5. I also played some of the mafia games including mafia 2 and mafia definitive editon 

## Conclusion 

I Can't wait to play gta 6 next year, 2025 is gonna be a good year for gaming.

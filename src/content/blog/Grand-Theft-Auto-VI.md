So if you haven't known already, gta 6 is the most anticipated game ever and its set to come out fall 2025 on the PS5 and the Xbox Series X/S. I'll be sharing my personal thoughts about the game and what i look forward to next year. 

## Trailer 2

So its been exactly 11 months since the first trailer for gta 6 came out. Many people including me have been anticipating that trailer 2 would come soon. Personally i think trailer 2 will most likely come before the end of this year around november-december, or it could possibily come out early next year. News surrounding gta 6 has been pretty dry and quiet lately.
